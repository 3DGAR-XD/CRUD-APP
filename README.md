# CRUD-APP
This is my own CRUD App with login and data saving (coming soon).

## USE
1. To start using the CRUD, you need to run this snippet in a sql editor how MySQL Workbench or PHPMyAdmin.
2. Start a PHP server and go to the home page, adding the project path, in my case it is http://localhost/CRUD-APP/public/
3. Now you need to register, and automatically the CRUD will start executing.

## Notes
This projects isn't polished at all, so it needs some tweaks.
